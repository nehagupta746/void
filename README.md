# VOID

> A real-time orbital intelligence platform for monitoring Near-Earth Objects and the International Space Station.

VOID turns public orbital data into a responsive mission-control experience. It combines live NEO discovery, close-approach intelligence, ISS telemetry, and interactive 3D visualisations in a mobile-first Next.js application.

## Highlights

- Mission Control dashboard with health-aware telemetry and mission feed
- Multi-target NEO trajectory display with interactive asteroid tracks
- Orbital Explorer powered by NASA NeoWs search and object-detail data
- Upcoming close-approach timeline with distance, velocity, and orbiting body
- ISS Command Center with live telemetry, pass predictions, map and vehicle views
- Reusable React Three Fiber scene foundation for Earth, orbital tracks, and spacecraft visualisation
- Progressive Web App metadata and installability preparation
- Responsive design for mobile through desktop viewports

## ISS Command Center

VOID’s ISS Command Center offers two interactive operational views, backed by live position telemetry and designed for clear at-a-glance orbital awareness.

### Geocentric tactical map

The map view presents a wireframe Earth, the ISS target lock, and multiple colour-coded orbital paths in a compact geocentric display. Operators can switch between the tactical map and vehicle model without leaving the ISS page.

### Holographic vehicle viewer

The vehicle view provides an interactive technical model of the International Space Station with subsystem selection, camera orientation controls, reset interaction, and a live telemetry readout below.

## Technology

- Next.js 15, App Router, React 19, and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 and custom HUD design tokens
- TanStack React Query for client caching and polling
- Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei for interactive orbital visualisation
- Framer Motion and GSAP for restrained interface motion
- Lucide React for interface icons

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm 10 or later

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nehagupta746/void.git
cd void
npm install
```

Start the app immediately:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The mission dashboard includes fallback catalog and approach data when external providers are unavailable, so the cloned project still renders without API keys. To enable live NASA, N2YO, and CelesTrak data, copy the environment template and add your own keys:

```bash
copy .env.example .env.local
```

```dotenv
NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
N2YO_API_KEY=your_n2yo_api_key
```

Never commit `.env.local` or expose these keys in browser code. VOID routes external requests through Next.js route handlers.

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available scripts

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimised production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run strict TypeScript validation |

## Data sources

VOID uses publicly available services through server-side API routes:

- [NASA NeoWs](https://api.nasa.gov/) for live NEO search and close-approach data
- [N2YO](https://www.n2yo.com/) for ISS pass prediction data
- [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/) for satellite and orbital reference data
- ISS position endpoints for live position telemetry

Service health is surfaced to the interface as connected, degraded, or offline. Fallback data is retained where possible so a temporary upstream failure does not leave the dashboard blank.

## Design system

The interface follows VOID’s retro-futuristic aerospace language: industrial panels, thin structural borders, monospaced telemetry, subtle scanlines, and purposeful motion. Visual tokens are defined centrally in `src/app/globals.css`; components use those tokens rather than ad-hoc visual values.

The current visual direction uses a near-black command surface with mint operational signals, amber warnings, and red critical states. It is designed to read as an orbital operations terminal, not a generic dashboard.

## 3D engine

The 3D foundation is modular and lazy-loaded to preserve page responsiveness:

- Earth, atmosphere, lighting, and star-background primitives
- Adaptive render quality and device pixel ratio
- Off-screen scene pausing through visibility observation
- Isolated scene boundaries to keep rendering work out of the broader UI tree
- Interactive orbit controls with mobile-safe constraints

The Mission Control view focuses on multi-object asteroid tracking. The ISS page retains the geocentric Earth and orbital-track display alongside its spacecraft view.

## Progressive Web App

PWA metadata, icons, theme colour, manifest configuration, and service-worker preparation are included. The project is structured for installation from Android Chrome; full offline-cache behaviour can be expanded in a future release.

## Quality checks

Before opening a pull request or publishing a change, run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Contributing

1. Create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Keep API secrets out of source control.
3. Preserve the existing design tokens and component boundaries.
4. Run type checking and a production build before submitting changes.
5. Describe API, UI, and performance impact in the pull request.
